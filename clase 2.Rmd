## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.







```{r}
x = seq(0,2*pi,0.1)
plot(x,sin(x),type="l",col="blue",lwd=3, xlab=expression(x), ylab="")
lines(x,cos(x),col="green",lwd=3)
lines(x, tan(x), col="purple",lwd=3)
legend("bottomleft",col=c("blue","green","purple"),
     legend=c("Seno","Coseno", "Tangente"), lwd=3, bty="l")
```
```{python}
print(1+1)
```
